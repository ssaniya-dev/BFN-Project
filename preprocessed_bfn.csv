Rountree,Brooks,"John Willis Rountree, a skilled carpenter and farmer, purchased the land of what eventually became Rountree farm in 1891 from James E. Henry in Morven, Brooks County. By 1930, the farm housed horses, mules, tobacco, a cotton house, a smokehouse, and water wells. Half of the farm was utilized as a timber reserve, while the remaining acres were used to produce crops like peaches, vegetables, pecans, corn, and tobacco. Part of the farm is currently leased as a peach orchard. The John & Emma Jane Rountree Farm was the first African American family to receive the Centennial Family Farm Award in 1994. As of 2001, the farm was being taken care of by grandchildren and cousins.

Morgan,Sumter,"The Morgan Centennial Farm, established in 1886 by former slave Nathan Morgan in Sumter County, Georgia, has remained a symbol of African American agricultural heritage for over a century. Nathan Morgan purchased 202 acres from A. Windsor, laying the foundation for a farm that would sustain generations of his family. Initially, the farm produced cotton, corn, peanuts, and vegetables, and it continues to yield crops such as peanuts, watermelon, and okra today.
Milton Morgan owned the farm from 1925 to 1947, during which he sold 60 acres, including one acre that became the site of Mount Zion A.M.E. Church, the family’s church. In 1952, after his father’s passing, Carranza Morgan repurchased the land and maintained its historic landscape, incorporating garden plots, fruit trees, and pastures while adapting the original outbuildings for modern agricultural use.
Recognized for its enduring legacy, the farm received the Centennial Family Farm Award in 1995, becoming the first African American farm in Georgia to earn this distinction. It was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1998 and was honored as an African American Centennial Heritage Farm in 2001. Today, the Morgan farm remains a testament to resilience, tradition, and the deep-rooted history of African American farming in Georgia.

Her landownership was safeguarded by a copy of the land deed, kept in her home to prevent disputes during the Reconstruction era. Though some acreage was lost over time, Anna retained 172 acres, which she passed down to her children. Despite having no formal education, she prioritized schooling for her family, sending one child to a private school in Social Circle while others worked alongside her on the farm. She also contributed lumber to the construction of Plainview Baptist Church, one of the oldest African American churches in the county.
